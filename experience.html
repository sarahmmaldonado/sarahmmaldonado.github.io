                <h2>Pincho - Cashier/Sever - April 2022</h2>
                <p>During my time working at Pincho, a small restaurant chain in South Florida, I learned many valuable lessons that let me succeed not only in the restaurant business but also in my everyday life. Being my first job, I faced challenges in the beginning as I adjusted to a fast-paced and high-pressure environment. However, being awarded employee of the month for my ability to exceed sales targets, demonstrate leadership, and maintain smooth operations during busy shifts proved to me that I am able to adapt to these kinds of stressful environments quickly. Being promoted to Employee Trainer taught me how to take a leadership position and aid people into succeeding in their own roles. I specifically remember an experience that greatly impacted me where over the course of a few weeks I encouraged my trainee to break out of her shell and make a lasting impression on both customers and other peers in the workplace. From my time at Pincho, I took many lessons that I have carried with me in both my professional and personal life. I learned how to thrive in high-pressure environments, improving my ability to stay calm and focused while multitasking. My role asan Employee Trainer taught me the value of leadership and how empowering others can lead to collective success. The experience also strengthened my communication skills, as I learned how to effectively listen to and understand the needs of both customers and the people that I worked with. Most importantly, I realized the importance of adaptability and resilience, skills that continue to serve me to this day, whether it's in a professional setting or personal challenges. This job gave me a strong foundation in teamwork, responsibility, and the ability to turn challenges into opportunities for growth.
